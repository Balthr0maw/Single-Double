# Single-Double

Hello Dear Users!

This projects my self coding about Cryptography. In this project, we can easily change PlainText To CipherText. You can look up the source code and learn much more.

---Usage---

If you're using Windows machine (must be updated .NET 4.7.2) just go to the directory and run it Single-Double.exe

bin -> Debug -> Single-Double.exe

If you encounter any problems, you can let me know.

Have fun :)
